# Grooveshark Desktop for Mac

This application aims to be a method of using Grooveshark on you Mac that provides functionality not otherwise capable for a web applicaiton.

## Todo

* Determine what functionality is most desired by you!

## Installation

1. Go to the [downloads](https://github.com/rich90usa/GSDesktopMac/downloads) tab on the right and download the .zip file.
2. Extract the .app from the archive and place in your Applications folder.

## Important Notes

* The play/pause key is hijacked by iTunes. There is a workaround available [on this blog post on freakified.net](http://www.freakified.net/tutorials/how-to-stop-itunes-from-opening-automatically-when-you-press-the-playpause-key-on-your-mac/) that works fantastically with this desktop application.
* _This is a work in progress._ It is by no means complete but what's there more or less matches the current feature set for the official desktop application.
