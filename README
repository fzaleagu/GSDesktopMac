Grooveshark Desktop for Mac
=============

This application aims to be a light method of using Grooveshark on you Mac while providing functionality not otherwise capable for a web applicaiton.

Installation
-------

1. Go to the downloads tab on the right and download the .zip file.
2. Extract the .app from the archive and place in your Applications folder.

Important Notes
------------

The play/pause key is hijacked by iTunes. There is a workaround available [on this blog post on freakified.net](http://www.freakified.net/tutorials/how-to-stop-itunes-from-opening-automatically-when-you-press-the-playpause-key-on-your-mac/) that works fantastically with this desktop application.
